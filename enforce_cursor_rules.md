# Enforce Cursor Rules

For any Cursor rules that apply to this repository, enforce them. Make sure that every rule is followed. Then generate a compliance report. The report should describe which parts of the repo are in compliance and which are not. Generate the compliance report in a temporary directory. If one doesn't exist, create one. Name it `tmp` or `temp`. Make sure that the directory is ignored in .gitignore.

After generating the report, offered to fix the issues. But don't fix anything until the user has given you permission.
