# Create Commit Message

Create a Git commit message for all the code that has been changed. Either staged or unstaged. The message should be short: one main sentence, summarizing the changes, and then 2 to 6 bullet points, depending on the complexity of the changes made. The commitment message should be written in an appropriate tone. Please also follow the standards below.

## Commit Message Standards

- **Format**: Use conventional commits format (`type: description`)
- **Types**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- **Description**: Use imperative mood, lowercase, no period (unless there are multiple sentences). Keep it succinct.


Here is an example:

```sh
fix: Improved logic for the main controller to fix bug where script would hang.
- Removed spaghetti code
- Improved the speed of execution by several seconds
- Created a test for the new behavior
```

Incorporate any additional information or directions that I give, if any.
Do not actually commit any code. Simply print out your proposed commitment message.
