# Create gitignore

Create a .gitignore file in the repo root if one doesn't exist. Include all of the standard exclusions that you would find in a typical gitignore. Pay particular attention to the language, languages, or frameworks of the repo. In addition, include the following:

```sh
# temporary files
tmp/
temp/
```

If a gitignore does exist, make sure that it complies with all of the requirements above, including the temporary files exclusions.
